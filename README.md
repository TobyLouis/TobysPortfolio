# Welcome to my Portfolio!
Hello! My name is Toby Trotta, an early-career professional seeking a data scientist or data analyst role. Residing in the greater Pittsburgh region, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a concentration in Actuarial Science from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania (EUP) (now Pennsylvania Western University), where I developed a strong interest in statistics and programming.

My academic foundation began with learning the core principles of data science, statistical programming, machine learning, and parallel computing using RStudio, leading to a lasting proficiency in, and an appreciation for, the R programming language. During my graduate studies at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), I expanded my technical toolkit by working primarily in Python, developing both probabilistic and deterministic operations research models, as well as conducting data science analyses using libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels within Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab environments.

I invite you to explore my growing portfolio!

### [A General Class of Additive Parametric Models for Recurrent Event Data](https://github.com/TobyLouis/TobysPortfolio/tree/main/Thesis)

My thesis was advised by Dr. Russell Stocker IV, Associate Professor of Mathematics at Indiana University of Pennsylvania's Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences. The full text can be found on [ProQuest](https://www.proquest.com/openview/408ecd24e6e05b01b624ef0013797b3b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y).

*The graphics in this section were created using a combination of RStudio packages: `ggplot`, `tikzDevice`, and `latex2exp`.*

*Abstract:* We propose a general class of additive parametric models to analyze recurrent event data that uses the effective age process given in Peña and Hollander [1]. We assume a negligible intervention effect is applied to each unit after an observed event which may be classified as perfect, minimal, or partial. Estimators are derived and their asymptotic properties are established under regularity conditions that are formulated using doubly-indexed processes. We investigate the finite sample properties via a simulation study in RStudio. The simulation study shows minimal and decreasing bias in the maximum likelihood estimators, and that the standard errors can be approximated using the inverse observed information matrix. The model and asymptotic properties are used to examine the indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma data set from Gonzalez, Peña, and Slate. [2]

### [RStudio Workshop](https://github.com/TobyLouis/TobysPortfolio/tree/main/RStudioWorkshop)

As a Research Assistant with IUP's Applied Research Lab (ARL), I was given the opportunity to host an RStudio Programming Workshop during IUP's Research Appreciation Week. During this two-day workshop, I instructed a class of approximately 10 participants. I encourage those who are interested in learning RStudio to view both the blank RMarkdown worksheets for practice and the respective "Key" files for answers at your own pace. :blush: Search above for the appropriate folder, or use the following link for file download: [RStudio Workshop Document Set](https://github.com/TobyLouis/TobysPortfolio/tree/main/RStudioWorkshop)
