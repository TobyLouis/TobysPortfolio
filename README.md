# A General Class of Additive Parametric Models for Recurrent Event Data

My master's thesis, advised by Dr. Russell Stocker IV, of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania's Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences.

**Abstract:** We propose a general class of additive parametric models to analyze recurrent event
data that uses the effective age process given in Pe˜na and Hollander. We assume a negligible
intervention effect is applied to each unit after an observed event which may be classified
as perfect, minimal, or partial. Estimators are derived and their asymptotic properties are
established under regularity conditions that are formulated using doubly-indexed processes.
We investigate the finite sample properties via a simulation study in RStudio. The simulation
study shows minimal and decreasing bias in the maximum likelihood estimators, and that
the standard errors can be approximated using the inverse observed information matrix. The
model and asymptotic properties are used to examine the indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
data set from Gonzalez, Pe˜na, and Slate
